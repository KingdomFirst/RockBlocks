# RockBlocks

This is an open-source repository of [Kingdom First Solutions](https://www.kingdomfirstsolutions.com/rock) for all public Rock RMS Blocks. Remember to check our [RockAssemblies](https://github.com/KingdomFirst/RockAssemblies) repo. All code in this repository is targeted for RockRMS version 8 or earlier. Version 9 support will be added in the future.

## Setup

The [RockAssemblies](https://github.com/KingdomFirst/RockAssemblies) and [RockBlocks](https://github.com/KingdomFirst/RockBlocks) repos are intended to be used together.

* `RockAssemblies` should be cloned to a sibling folder of the `RockWeb` folder (for reference relativity).
* `RockBlocks` should be cloned directly to `Plugins/rock_kfs`.

Example folder structure:

    .                            # Root GitHub or SDK folder
    ├── KFSRockAssemblies        # RockAssemblies Repo Root Folder
    │   ├── rocks.kfs...         # Specific KFS Assemblies
    │   └── ...
    ├── RockWeb                  # Core RockWeb folder from GitHub or SDK
    │   ├── Plugins              # Core Plugins folder from GitHub or SDK
    │   │   ├ rocks_kfs          # RockBlocks Repo Root Folder
    │   │   │   ├ Bulldozer      # Specific KFS Blocks
    │   │   │   └ ...
    │   │   └ ...
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

## Usage

Feel free to exercise your coding muscles and clone our repo.  We welcome pull requests if you'd like to contribute back!

If you prefer the one-click install method, we have also published several of our plugins to the [Rock Shop](https://www.rockrms.com/rockshop).

## History

We've worked with [Rock RMS](https://www.rockrms.com/) since its beginning and have helped hundreds of organizations with migrations (check out [Bulldozer](https://github.com/KingdomFirst/Bulldozer)), reports, and custom plugins.
