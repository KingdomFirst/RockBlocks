		<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>*</strong><strong>Atheism Conference - THIS FRIDAY &amp; SATURDAY</strong><br /> <br /> After encountering Atheists, many Christians feel discouraged; is our Faith able to be supported with legitimate evidence, or do we just have to hold on to "blind faith"? Is the God of the Bible actually good and worth following-- and if so, how can we reconcile the picture of a loving Savior with the picture of an angry God people sometimes depict from the Old Testament? In Understanding and Answering Atheism, a seminar by Ravi Zacharias International Ministries, we'll learn how to honestly examine our faith, and how to be challenged-- as well as how to lovingly and constructively engage the Atheists we know. The conference takes place on&nbsp;<strong>THIS Friday and Saturday</strong>.
